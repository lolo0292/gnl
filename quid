Goal:
- Print each line one by one (so when \n is reached)
- Print NULL when there is an error or when the end is reached
- Avoid memory leak

Steps:
- Handle data with a clinked list to store temporarly the text read
- Store the text read in stash which will change with each read call

- Read the data with function read 
			(ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbytes))
- fildes : FD from which to read
- *buf : a pointer to the buffer in which the data read is stored
- nbytes : max nbr of bytes to read from fd and store in the buffer
- data will be stored in the stash
- if \n found --> reading stops full line is found

- extract line
- traverse the content stored in stash
- a line ends when \n found or end of file

- clean up the data 
- after extracting a line free the stash
